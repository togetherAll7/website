We are excited to introduce `@react-three/xr` v6, a major overhaul to the `@react-three/xr` package, that brings new and exciting AR and VR capabilities to your React Three Fiber (R3F) applications. We focussed on making it easier than ever to create interactive and immersive experiences, expanding the possibilities of what you can achieve with the React-Three ecosystem.

Want to get started with `@react-three/xr`? In the following we will introduce how you can turn your existing R3F app into an AR or VR web application. Alternatively check out [our brand new documentation](https://docs.pmnd.rs/xr/).

## How to Enable XR in Your R3F App

Enabling XR in your React Three Fiber app is straightforward. Hereâ€™s how you can do it with a simple example that toggles a 3D box's color between red and blue when clicked:

0. **Install the dependency**

```bash
npm install @react-three/xr@latest
```

1. **Create an XR Store:** Start by creating an XR store using `createXRStore()`.

   ```jsx
   import { createXRStore } from '@react-three/xr'

   import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber'
   import { XR } from '@react-three/xr'
   import { useState } from 'react'

   const store = createXRStore()
   ```

2. **Enter AR Mode:** Add a button to your app that allows users to enter AR mode by calling `store.enterAR()` when the button is clicked.

   ```jsx
   <button onClick={() => store.enterAR()}>Enter AR</button>
   ```

3. **Wrap with XR Component:** Wrap your 3D content inside the `<XR>` component and pass the store as a prop.

   ```jsx
   export function App() {
     const [red, setRed] = useState(false)
     return (
       <>
         <button onClick={() => store.enterAR()}>Enter AR</button>
         <Canvas>
           <XR store={store}>
             <mesh
               pointerEventsType={{ deny: 'grab' }}
               onClick={() => setRed(!red)}
               position={[0, 1, -1]}
             >
               <boxGeometry />
               <meshBasicMaterial color={red ? 'red' : 'blue'} />
             </mesh>
           </XR>
         </Canvas>
       </>
     )
   }
   ```

This example demonstrates how you can integrate XR into your R3F application, allowing you to build interactive immersive experiences with just a few lines of code.

## Tutorials and Features

To help you make the most out of the `@react-three/xr` features, we offer a variety of tutorials to get you started:

- **[Interactions](https://docs.pmnd.rs/xr/tutorials/interactions):** Learn how to handle user interactions within your XR environment.
- **[Options](https://docs.pmnd.rs/xr/tutorials/options):** Customize settings to fit your specific needs.
- **[Object Detection](https://docs.pmnd.rs/xr/tutorials/object-detection):** Implement object detection seamlessly.
- **[Origin](https://docs.pmnd.rs/xr/tutorials/origin):** Manage the origin point as well as rotation and scale of your XR scene.
- **[Teleport](https://docs.pmnd.rs/xr/tutorials/teleport):** Enable teleportation as a way of navigating your scene.
- **[Gamepad](https://docs.pmnd.rs/xr/tutorials/gamepad):** Leverage the gamepads of the controllers.
